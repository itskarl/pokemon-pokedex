# POKEMON POKEDEX PROJECT

_Please Note: This site purely reliant on the PokeAPI to function correctly. The API is often slow or occasionally down, which may affect this pokedex's functionality. Check [Poke API](http://pokeapi.co) for resource status._

### DESCRIPTION
Gotta Catch 'Em All!

This project is a novel web app that allows you to visualize Pokemon data in a fun and dynamic way. This project was an exercise in utilizing javascript API calls and DOM methods on a single page.

### DESIGN
I created this site as a very modern pokedex but still pays an homage to the original games and style. The red and white patterns and shapes are a nod to the iconic pokeball. The animation style was chosen to give the site a slight mechanical/analog feel.

### LANGUAGES USED
HTML, CSS, JAVSASCRIPT, SASS

### FEATURES
Fun things to note:

- Website is fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile! Please enjoy on different platforms!
- Stat bars are dynamically generated as percentage bars
- Pokemon data are pulled from the PokeAPI, but images are borrowed from pokemon.com. Consistent ID numbers on both resources made this possible.
- Each Pokemon loads in with a random animation from Animate.CSS resource
- "Your Pokemon Section" is dynamically generated and additional functionality has been added to allow recall of former pokemon and an X button to close each "tab".


### RESOURCES

For this project, the following resources and frameworks were utilized in building the site:

- [Poke API](http://pokeapi.co): the API provided all stats, flavor text, and additional data
- [Materialize CSS Framework](https://materializecss.com/): provided the grid framework
- [Pokemon.com](https://www.pokemon.com/us/): images from the official Pokemon website and Nintendo.
- [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/): tool for simple site animations
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery): specialized icons!
