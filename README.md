# POKEMON POKEDEX PROJECT 

_Please Note: This site purely reliant on the PokeAPI to function appropriately. The site is often slow or occasionally down. Check [Poke API](http://pokeapi.co) for resource status._

### DESCRIPTION
This project is a novel web app that allows you to visualize pokemon data in a fun and dynamic way. This project was an excercise in utilizing javascript API calls and DOM methods on a single page. 

### DESIGN
I created this site as a very modern pokedex but with an homage to the original games and style. The red and white patterns and shapes are a nod to the iconic pokeball. Animation options were chosen to give the site a slight mechanical/analog feel. 

### LANGUAGES USED 
HTML, CSS, JAVSASCRIPT, SASS 

### FEATURES
Fun things to note:

- Website is fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile! View on different platforms!
- Stat bars are dynamically generated as percentage bars
- Pokemon data are pulled from the PokeAPI, but images are borrowed from pokemon.com. Consistent ID numbers on both resources made this possible. 
- Each pokemon loads with in a random animation from animate css resource
- "Your Pokemon Section" is dynamically generated and additional functionality has been added to allow recall of former pokemon and an X button to close each "tab".
